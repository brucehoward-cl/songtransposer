For guitar players, transposing songs from one key to another - to better suit vocals, for example - can be
a time-consuming complicated process. This software solves that problem.

Users can enter a chord progression, what key they'd like it transposed to, and get back the new progression
in the desired key.

The Factory Method Design Pattern was used to create the distinct chords in the chord progression.
    - This will allow adding the ability to handle different chord types in the future.
